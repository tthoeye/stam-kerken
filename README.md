STAM: Blijven Plakken in Gent
=============================

This is a PoC web application for the Ghent City Museum (STAM) exhibition on Immigration. It features a number of points-of-interest listed on the exhibition's public website: http://www.blijvenplakkeningent.be/blikvangers. These places are recognizable throughout the city thanks to a number of pillars that display pictures and text about the events that happened there. The museum also provides a number of narrated walking routes, through audio files that are downloadble from their website.

This application is based on the CITADEL on the move - Mobile application template for Pois Of Interest template.
